# nice_hooks

A python package for making working with torch hooks easier. You can bind hooks to a modules using a [flexible pattern string](https://nice-hooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modulepaths.html) and it contains utilities for working with [activation caches](https://nice-hooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/activationcache.html).

Many of the ideas are based on the [`TransformerLens`](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens) library, but written so it can work with *any* pytorch model.
